# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Numerous automatic driver sleepiness detection systems have been studied in recent years in academic and industrial research, but none are now employed extensively in day-to-day life due to excessive cost or insufficient effectiveness.
In this project, we make an effort to address this issue by introducing a real-time driver drowsiness detection system that makes use of computer vision techniques to watch and analyze a driver's face and notify them when they start to nod off.
